# Overview of transit infrastructure costs

## Introduction
This document will give background on some basic research about transit costs, how to do forecasting of costs and some basic footprint data for current transit projects in order to give users reasonable estimates to start with. These types of estimates are quite hard to come across and typically little attention to clean accounting is done after project completion. To remediate, this project uses data gathered by reputable institutions and tries to integrate them into this document.

## Litterature

As mentionned above, little litterature is available to the general public and databases covering multiple projects across geographies and purchasing power differences are even scarcer. The best reference these authors found were Goldwyn et al,2023 who conducted a review of multiple projects, aggregated the data and conducted field interviews with stakeholders to understand why transit costs were so high. This research is focused on major projects for high capacity modes. The ITDP also has a planning manual which gives some indication of construction cost for BRT infrastructure (Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, & Protocubo Consultoria Ltda.,2018).\

These tools give aggregated estimates of project costs across multiple types of transit. While this could be seen as lacking accuracy, Flyvbjerg & Gardner (2023) tends to indicate that attempts to improve project estimates by concentrating on minute details of the project rather than taking an estimate from similar types of assets classes is poor practice as it leads authors of estimates to estimate risk poorly and overestimate the uniqueness of their project. Reference Class Forecasting(RCF) where a project is categorized into a broad project class and then an estimate based on statistical data tends to yield better outocmes by baking in risks inherent to the project type into the estimate.\

Coming back to Goldwyn et al., they indicate that factors inducing larger costs in transit in North America are related to 5 factors:
 - Physical Structure: North American Transit agencies tend to overbuild stations to accomodate various groups(transit agencies) leading to larger than required stations which inflates costs. Utility and interagency costs are also absorbed as hard costs
 - Physical Structure - Systems Lack of standardization around commoditized items like escalators and standardization also leads to inflated costs due to the lack of learning curve from frequent repetition.
 - Labor
 - Procurement and Soft Costs (Procurement):
